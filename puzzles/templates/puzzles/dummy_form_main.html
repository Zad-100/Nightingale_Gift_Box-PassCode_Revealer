<!--
  This page is where Nightingale is introduced to the 3rd part of the puzzles
  app where she's asked to fill up a form in categories about how much she
  knows herself. Next, she's told that some categories are mandatory to
  fill and some are optional that she can select. After that, she's shown
  the whole structure of the form as `name_name` along with the
  `number_of_questions` in them. The required ones are shown as a list and
  the optional ones are shown as radio buttons.

  After she hits the submit button on this page she shall be redirected to
  the first name form page. After completing it and submitting it,
  she will be redirected to a success page and shown a button to go for
  the next form, and so on.

    How Much Do You Know About Yourself?

    We happen to know more about you than you do yourself and hence, this test!

      ⚠ There are a set of questions that you need to answer. The questions are
      divided into various categories like colours and fashion, food, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      ☝🏻 Some of them are mandatory to answer and some are optional. You can
      choose which category you want to answer questions from among the
      optional ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      ☝🏻 Each question carries some hidden weight. The sum of the weights of the
      questions you answer correctly will be the overall score.
    </p>
    <p>
      😏 "How would you match my answers to the answers in the answer key
      exactly?", you ask? Well, we have an algorithm and ChatGPT 4 in place
      to take care of that. So, don't worry about it. Just answer the questions
      as honestly as you can and in any way you see fit to answer that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      👇🏻 Below is the structure of the form. The categories are listed along with
      the number of questions in them. The required ones are shown as a list
      and the optional ones are shown as radio buttons. 
    </p>
    <p>
      💡 You can select the optional ones you want to answer questions from.
