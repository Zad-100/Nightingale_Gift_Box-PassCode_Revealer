<!--
  This is the template for the slider puzzle. It is a 3x3 grid of images that
  can be moved around. The images are stored in the
  "puzzles/static/puzzles/images/slices" folder and are named slice_1, slice_2,
  and so on. The 9th image is a blank image. The images are shuffled and placed
  in the grid. The user can then move the images around by clicking on them.
  The goal is to get the images in order from 1 to 9.
