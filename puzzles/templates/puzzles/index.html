  <p>
    Welcome to the puzzles app. This is a simple web app designed to help you
    get to the combination that opens your gift box. There are three digits in
    the combination, so we have three puzzles for you to solve. Each puzzle
    will give you a digit of the combination. Once you have all three digits,
    you can open the box and get your gift!
