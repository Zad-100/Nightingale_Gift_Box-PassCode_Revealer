      Welcome to the puzzles app. 😊 This is a simple web app designed to help you
      get to the combination that opens your gift box. 😏 There are three digits in
      the combination, so we have three puzzles for you to solve. 😌 Each puzzle
      will give you a digit of the combination. Once you have all three digits,
      you can open the box and get your gift! 🙌🏻
