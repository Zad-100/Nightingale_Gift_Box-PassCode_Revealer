    <img id="sldrPic" src="{% static 'puzzles/images/Slider_Puzzle_Sexy_Pic_Edited.png' %}" alt="First Pic You Ever Shared With Me"> <br>

    <div id="hiddenMessage">
      <p>
        This was the very first pic that you ever shared with me (and that was
        over mail, lol, coz mko baut pasand aai thi and I needed full HD.
        <s>kyaa mtlb 1080p mai chaahiye thaa 😈</s>).
        You would think why that means so much to me.
        Well, that somehow gave me the confidence that you trust me and em
        a good man, girls can trust themselves with. 🤷🏻‍♂️ (lol, after that
