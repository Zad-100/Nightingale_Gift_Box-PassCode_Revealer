            PICK out the REPEATING letters in each of the crossword
            answers/words.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, if the answers are: ["YOUR", "DIMPPLEESS", "ARRREEEE",
            "SWOOOONWORRTHYYY"], then the repeating letters for each word would
            be:
            <ul>
              <li>"YOUR":  <\\no repeating letters\\></li>
              <li>"DIMPPLEESS":  P, E, S</li>
              <li>"ARRREEEE":  R, E</li>
              <li>"SWOOOONWORRTHYYY":  O, R, W, Y</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <P>
            So, your list of repeating letters from each word would be:
            ["P", "E", "S", "R", "E", "O", "R", "W", "Y"]
          </P>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-2">STEP 2</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
          <p>
            SORT the list obtained in STEP 1 in alphabetical order and
            ELIMINATE the DUPLICATES.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, your new list of letters would be:
            ["E", "O", "P", "R", "S", "W", "Y"]
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-2">STEP 3</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
          <p>
            ELIMINATE the sequence of letters that APPEAR CONSECUTIVELY in the
            alphabetical order in the list obtained in STEP 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in the list obtained in this case, the sequence of letters that
            appear consecutively in the alphabetical order are ["O", "P"] and
            ["R", "S"]. So, we remove them from the list. The new list would be:
            ["E", "W", "Y"]
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-2">STEP 4</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
          <p>
            Input the final resulting string obtained in the below input box and
            hit the "Check" button!
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in Mind: DON'T INCLUDE ANY SPACES in the final string. Also,
            the final string is case-insensitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in this example, you could have entered: "EWY" in the input box.
